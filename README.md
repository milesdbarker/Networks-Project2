In general, this project was confusing for the most part. It involved a lot of self teaching
for exactly what the client was meant to do.
In terms of high level approach, I found the Suggested Implementation Approach to be useful
and followed that.
I didn't have many larger specific difficulties, and once I understood how FTP works and what
each of the commands are supposed to do, the actual implementation wasn't incredibly complex.
Then for testing, I tested the program as I went along, and then at the end I tried every
command a few times in different ways to make sure they all work correctly.
